<strong>Parkrose Heights Neighborhood Association</strong>
<p>A new Parkrose Heights Neighborhood Association is in the process of being born. Meeting dates and times can be found on the <a href="https://www.portland.gov/neighborhoods/northeast/parkrose-heights">official City of Portland website</a> or on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61552250700550">Parkrose Heights Neighborhood Association Facebook page</a>. Currently they are scheduled for the fourth Monday of every month (except December) at 7:00pm at the Parkrose United Methodist Church.</p>

<p>The new neighborhood association has no affiliation with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ParkroseHeights/">old, now apparently defunct Parkrose Hights Assocatiation of Neighbors (PHAN)</a></p>
 
<p>(<em>parkroseheights.org used to be the website for PHAN, but they let the domain name lapse. This site is not affiliated with PHAN, the new neighborhood association, or any other organization.</em>)</p>

<strong>Earthquake and emergency preparation</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>"<a href="https://www.portland.gov/pbem/about-beecn">Basic Earthquake Emergency Communication Nodes</a>" are locations in Portland where people can go to access emergency communications services if telephone service is down after an earthquake, or to report severe damage or injury. <strong>Knott City Park is Parkrose Heights's designated Basic Earthquake Emergency Communication Node</strong>. You might also want to <a href="https://www.portland.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/pbem-beecn-web-handout-2018-en.pdf">download and print this map</a> of other locations, in case the big one hits while you're in another neighborhood.</p></li>
<li>The neighborhood is covered by the <a href="https://portlandprepares.org/net-teams/east/argay-parkrose/">Argay-Parkrose Neighborhood Emergency Team</a> for earthquake preparedness. Visit their site for more information on how to prepare and how you can volunteer.</li>
